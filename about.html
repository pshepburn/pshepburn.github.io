<div class="blurb">
	<p>My name is Peter. I'm a Sociologist and Demographer nearing completion of a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
	<p>My research focuses on under-studied stratification processes and the overlapping domains through which inequality is reproduced and transmitted. In my dissertation project, I explore ways that employment practices and public policies limit support available to children and low-income families. I focus on working parents with nonstandard or unstable schedules; children who receive less developmentally supportive or more disruptive care because of the shifts that their parents work; and the relatives who step in to care for these kids when other providers arenâ€™t available. I use new methods and novel data to more effectively measure and analyze the difficulties that these families face in the U.S. today.</p>
	<p>In addition to my dissertation, I have a number of collaborative projects on the go.</p>
	<p>* With Paul Chung, I'm working on a project estimating the effect of mass incarceration on the availability of kin support.</p>
	<p>* With Amal Harrati...</p>
