	<p>Hey there! I'm an <a href="https://sasn.rutgers.edu/about-us/faculty-staff/peter-hepburn">assistant professor of Sociology</a> at <a href="https://sasn.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University-Newark</a> and a research fellow at the <a href="https://evictionlab.org/">Eviction Lab</a> at Princeton University. I received my PhD from the joint program in <a href="https://sociology.berkeley.edu/">Sociology</a> and <a href="https://www.site.demog.berkeley.edu/">Demography</a> at the University of California, Berkeley in 2018. This site is meant to provide some basic information about me and my research. If you have questions, <a href="mailto:peter.hepburn@rutgers.edu">get in touch</a>.</p>
	<p>You can read about <a href="/research">my research</a> and check out <a href="/papers">some papers</a> I've written, as well as browse <a href="/media">a few news stories</a> in which I'm quoted.</p>
