	<p>Hey there! I'm a research scientist in the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. I received my PhD from the joint program in Sociology and Demography at the University of California, Berkeley in May, 2018. This site is meant to provide some basic information about me and my research. If you have questions, <a href="mailto:pshepburn@gmail.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
	<p>You can read about <a href="/research">my research</a> and check out <a href="/papers">some papers</a> I've written.</p>
	<p>If you'd rather cut to the chase, here's <a href="/hepburn_cv.pdf">my CV</a> (last updated June, 2018).
