title: My Research

<div class="blurb">
	<p>My research examines how changes to three core social institutions - work, criminal justice, and housing â€” have served to produce and perpetuate inequality. I use a variety of quantitative methods to demonstrate how disparities in exposure to precarious work, the criminal justice system, and housing instability are maintained through the mechanism of the family. The first branch of my research centers on parental work scheduling, child care arrangements, and family structure. The second branch explores the reach of the criminal justice system, especially in ways that commonly-available data make difficult to measure. The third branch explores the causes and consequences of eviction. Taken as a whole, my work contributes to the literature on families, mass incarceration, employment, and stratification and to our understanding of the equality of opportunity in modern America.</p>

	<p>I have a number of projects on the go.</p>
	<p>- I'm working on a set of papers related to parental working schedules, childcare arrangements, and family well-being.</p>
	<p>- I'm also working with Matt Desmond and the <a href="http://www.evictionlab.org/">Eviction Lab</a> at Princeton University to analyze spatial and temporal variations in eviction patterns in the United States.</p>
	<p>- <a href="http://www.paulchung.org/">Paul Chung</a> and I have written a paper estimating racial differences in the effect of mass imprisonment on the availability of kin support.</p>
	<p>- With <a href="https://amalharrati.com/">Amal Harrati</a>, I've written a paper characterizing and analyzing trajectories of employment and disability in a large American manufacturing firm.</p>
	<p>- <a href="https://law.yale.edu/issa-kohler-hausmann">Issa Kohler-Hausmann</a>, <a href="https://law.yale.edu/studying-law-yale/degree-programs/graduate-programs/jsd-program/jsd-candidate-profiles/angela-zorro-medina">Angela Zorro Medina</a>, and I are analyzing a set of administrative records from New York City to determine life-time risk of exposure to a number of criminal justice outcomes across race, sex, and cohort. 
	<p>When not working on these various and sundry projects, I tend to run a lot. I've maintained a one-marathon-per-year pace since 2010. This may not qualify strictly as "research," but I do think it's an invaluable part of my research process.</p>
