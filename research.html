	<p>My research focuses on stratification processes related to family, work, and childcare. In my dissertation project, I explore ways that employment practices and public policies limit support available to children and low-income families. I focus on working parents with nonstandard or unstable schedules; children who receive less developmentally supportive or more disruptive care because of the shifts that their parents work; and the relatives who step in to care for these kids when other providers arenâ€™t available. I use new methods and novel data to more effectively measure and analyze the difficulties that these families face in the U.S. today.</p>
	<p>In addition to my dissertation, I have a number of collaborative projects on the go.</p>
	<p>* <a href="http://www.paulchung.org/">Paul Chung</a> and I are working on a project estimating racial differences in the effect of mass incarceration on the availability of kin support.</p>
	<p>* With <a href="https://amalharrati.com/">Amal Harrati</a>, I'm working on a paper characterizing and analyzing trajectories of employment and disability in a large American manufacturing firm.</p>
	<p>* <a href="https://law.yale.edu/issa-kohler-hausmann">Issa Kohler-Hausmann</a>, <a href="https://law.yale.edu/studying-law-yale/degree-programs/graduate-programs/jsd-program/jsd-candidate-profiles/angela-zorro-medina">Angela Zorro Medina</a>, and I are analyzing a set of administrative records from New York City to determine life-time risk of exposure to a number of criminal justice outcomes across race, sex, and cohort.
